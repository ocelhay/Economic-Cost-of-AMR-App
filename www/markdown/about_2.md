#### Background

Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a colossal threat to global health and incurs high economic costs to society. Economic evaluations of antimicrobials and other interventions such as diagnostics and vaccines that affect their consumption rarely include the costs of AMR. This leads to misinformed recommendations concerning their adoption and sub-optimal policies. Our objective is to estimate the economic cost of AMR per antibiotic consumed, stratified by drug class and national economic development status.

#### Methods

The model comprises three components: an estimate of the association between human antibiotic consumption and subsequent resistance; the economic costs of AMR for key pathogens; and consumption data for antibiotic classes that drive resistance in these organisms. These components were used to calculate the economic cost of AMR per antibiotic consumed for different drug classes, using data from Thailand and the United States as representatives of low/middle and high income countries.
